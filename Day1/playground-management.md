Salesforce Environment Setup: Playground Management
A Trailhead Playground is a dedicated, free Salesforce organization (org) provided for hands-on practice. This file outlines the technical steps taken to configure and manage this development environment.
1. Creating the Trailhead Playground
   The playground acts as a "sandbox" or lab where customizations can be made without impacting a real business production environment.
   Action: Initiated the playground creation through the Trailhead module interface.
   Verification: Confirmed the setup by clicking the Launch button, which provides single-sign-on (SSO) access to the instance.
2. Security & Credential Management
   While the Launch button is the primary access point, manual credentials are required for advanced developer tasks like authorizing the Salesforce CLI or logging into the Salesforce Mobile App.
   Locating the Username: Accessed the Playground Starter app to retrieve the unique system-generated username.
   Resetting Password: Initiated a password reset from within the org settings to receive a temporary link via email, allowing for a permanent password configuration.
3. Installing Apps and Managed Packages
   Packages allow developers to load pre-built configurations, custom objects, or sample data into an org for testing.
   Package ID (04t): Identified the specific Package ID starting with 04t required for the challenge.
   Installation Process:
   Navigated to the Install a Package tab within the Playground Starter app.
   Pasted the unique Package ID (e.g., the ID for the Dashboard Pal component).
   Selected Install for Admins Only to ensure proper security permissions.
   Confirmation: Verified the successful installation by navigating to Setup > Installed Packages to view the components.
4. Technical Skills Gained
   Understanding the difference between a Trailhead Playground and a Developer Edition (DE) Org.
   Navigating the Lightning Experience interface and App Launcher.
   Managing Connected Accounts and identifying package components through the Setup menu.
